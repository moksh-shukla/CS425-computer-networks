First find out the ip address of the system by typing `ifconfig -a` in linux systems. Then run the chat application by executing `python3 server.py <IP Address> <PORT No.>` and `python3 client.py <IP Address> <PORT No.>` in 2 separate terminals. The IP Address and PORT No. should be same in both the execution of server and client scripts. Run the client script in other multiple terminals as different users and see the chat application working
To exit the chatroom, type `exit` in the terminal.
